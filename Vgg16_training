Here's the complete code for training and evaluation of VGG16 transfer learning with 2 classes:
```
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the device (GPU or CPU)
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Load the pre-trained VGG16 model
model = torchvision.models.vgg16(pretrained=True)

# Freeze the layers except the last one
for param in model.parameters():
	param.requires_grad = False

# Replace the last layer with a new one for 2 classes
model.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(4096, 2)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Load your dataset and data loader
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize((224, 224)), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])

train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder('path/to/train/directory', transform=transform)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder('path/to/test/directory', transform=transform)
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(10):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
	for images, labels in train_loader:
		# Forward pass
		images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
		optimizer.zero_grad()
		outputs = model(images)
		loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
		loss.backward()
		optimizer.step()

# Evaluate the model
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
.correct = 0
.total = 0
for images, labels in test_loader:
	images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
	outputs = model(images)
	_, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
	.total += labels.size(0)
	.correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

accuracy = .correct / .total
print('Test Accuracy: %d %%' % (100 * accuracy))

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'vgg16_transfer_learning.pth')
```
This code assumes you have your dataset organized in separate directories for training and testing, with subdirectories for each class. You need to replace 'path/to/train/directory' and 'path/to/test/directory' with the actual paths to your dataset directories.

Note that this code uses the `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` dataset loader, which expects your dataset to be organized in the following structure:
```
path/to/train/directory/
class1/
image1.jpg
image2.jpg
...
class2/
image1.jpg
image2.jpg
...
```
Similarly for the test directory.

Also, make sure to adjust the hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs) and the training settings according to your specific problem.





To display the training accuracy and loss during training, you can modify the training loop to include calculations and print statements for these metrics. Here's an updated version of the code:
```
# Train the model
for epoch in range(10):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
	for images, labels in train_loader:
		# Forward pass
		images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
		optimizer.zero_grad()
		outputs = model(images)
		loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
		loss.backward()
		optimizer.step()

		# Calculate training accuracy
		_, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
		total = labels.size(0)
		correct = (predicted == labels).sum().item()
		accuracy = correct / total

		# Print training loss and accuracy
		print('Epoch: %d, Loss: %.3f, Accuracy: %.3f %%' % (epoch+1, loss.item(), 100 * accuracy))

# Evaluate the model
...
```
This will print the training loss and accuracy for each epoch. You can adjust the print statement to include additional information or modify the formatting as needed.

Additionally, you can use a library like `tensorboard` to visualize the training process and track metrics like loss and accuracy over time. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the training process and help you identify trends and issues.
